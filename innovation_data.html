Although there is significant academic CM&S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product.","Most undergraduate engineering programs have some type of senior design program or senior capstone project which is a part of an engineering design course. Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students\u2019 creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program.","The FDA's Modeling and Simulation Working Group (ModSim WG) started as a grassroots movement to coordinate modeling expertise at FDA. There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature.","Leads lean efforts ","Helping HHS  to engage their users in content development","knowledgeable abour PRA (Paper Reduction Act) and how to do UX (user experience)","NaN","Work on innovation projects of CMS","https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/04/making-a-difference-innovation-pathway-and-entrepreneurs-in-residence/","NaN","Conducted a employee survey ","Developing intel policies and procedures ","Thinking about underseved populations like children","Follows principles 2, 4, 5","cross-agency security group for mobile","Government problems shared with higher education + the Lean Startup method to connect with industry course","Approaches and program","Conduct challenges","NaN","Developing and implementing new methods of internal business processes/process management","New technology for secretary's communciation and sounding board","Innovative ways to bring interns into government (vsfs.state.gov)","Innovation Lab and iLead","programs and approaches","NaN","Secretary of state's team responsible for collaboration between state, public, and private sector and civil society, the home of innovation at state!","developing innovation policy","developing an innovation community within state","YALI program","Top innovation thinker for Army","Principle #1: Anyone can innovate. innovation challenges like Google 20%","Actual specific innovating, approach","Manages large scale culture change","NaN","Provide independent advice and recommendations to DOD on innovative means to address future challenges in terms of integrated change to organizational structure and processes, business and functional concepts, and technology applications","create and disseminate new ideas, tech, products, processes","Hackathons, Hacking 4 Defense (H4X), (H4D), Lean Startup/I-Corps","produces paradigm shifting innovation, produces entrepeneurs","Skunworks - like team in dod","Set of 6 principles adopted by several donors and organizations to incorporate innovations in international development","approaches of using innovative contracting and multisector partnership","approaches, programs, methodologies, source innovators, change the way we do business","innovation design team with global development lab","programs and approaches","US Global Development Lab innovation lab within USAID","Venture capital, grant program ","We onboard experts onto our team that can help quantify the impact of the innovative work people are doing across government.

Although there is significant academic CM&S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product.","Most undergraduate engineering programs have some type of senior design program or senior capstone project which is a part of an engineering design course. Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students\u2019 creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program.","The FDA's Modeling and Simulation Working Group (ModSim WG) started as a grassroots movement to coordinate modeling expertise at FDA. There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature.","Leads lean efforts ","Helping HHS  to engage their users in content development","knowledgeable abour PRA (Paper Reduction Act) and how to do UX (user experience)","NaN","Work on innovation projects of CMS","https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/04/making-a-difference-innovation-pathway-and-entrepreneurs-in-residence/","NaN","Conducted a employee survey ","Developing intel policies and procedures ","Thinking about underseved populations like children","Follows principles 2, 4, 5","cross-agency security group for mobile","Government problems shared with higher education + the Lean Startup method to connect with industry course","Approaches and program","Conduct challenges","NaN","Developing and implementing new methods of internal business processes/process management","New technology for secretary's communciation and sounding board","Innovative ways to bring interns into government (vsfs.state.gov)","Innovation Lab and iLead","programs and approaches","NaN","Secretary of state's team responsible for collaboration between state, public, and private sector and civil society, the home of innovation at state!","developing innovation policy","developing an innovation community within state","YALI program","Top innovation thinker for Army","Principle #1: Anyone can innovate. innovation challenges like Google 20%","Actual specific innovating, approach","Manages large scale culture change","NaN","Provide independent advice and recommendations to DOD on innovative means to address future challenges in terms of integrated change to organizational structure and processes, business and functional concepts, and technology applications","create and disseminate new ideas, tech, products, processes","Hackathons, Hacking 4 Defense (H4X), (H4D), Lean Startup/I-Corps","produces paradigm shifting innovation, produces entrepeneurs","Skunworks - like team in dod","Set of 6 principles adopted by several donors and organizations to incorporate innovations in international development","approaches of using innovative contracting and multisector partnership","approaches, programs, methodologies, source innovators, change the way we do business","innovation design team with global development lab","programs and approaches","US Global Development Lab innovation lab within USAID","Venture capital, grant program ","We onboard experts onto our team that can help quantify the impact of the innovative work people are doing across government.

Although there is significant academic CM&S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product.","Most undergraduate engineering programs have some type of senior design program or senior capstone project which is a part of an engineering design course. Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students\u2019 creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program.","The FDA's Modeling and Simulation Working Group (ModSim WG) started as a grassroots movement to coordinate modeling expertise at FDA. There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature.","Leads lean efforts ","Helping HHS  to engage their users in content development","knowledgeable abour PRA (Paper Reduction Act) and how to do UX (user experience)","NaN","Work on innovation projects of CMS","https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/04/making-a-difference-innovation-pathway-and-entrepreneurs-in-residence/","NaN","Conducted a employee survey ","Developing intel policies and procedures ","Thinking about underseved populations like children","Follows principles 2, 4, 5","cross-agency security group for mobile","Government problems shared with higher education + the Lean Startup method to connect with industry course","Approaches and program","Conduct challenges","NaN","Developing and implementing new methods of internal business processes/process management","New technology for secretary's communciation and sounding board","Innovative ways to bring interns into government (vsfs.state.gov)","Innovation Lab and iLead","programs and approaches","NaN","Secretary of state's team responsible for collaboration between state, public, and private sector and civil society, the home of innovation at state!","developing innovation policy","developing an innovation community within state","YALI program","Top innovation thinker for Army","Principle #1: Anyone can innovate. innovation challenges like Google 20%","Actual specific innovating, approach","Manages large scale culture change","NaN","Provide independent advice and recommendations to DOD on innovative means to address future challenges in terms of integrated change to organizational structure and processes, business and functional concepts, and technology applications","create and disseminate new ideas, tech, products, processes","Hackathons, Hacking 4 Defense (H4X), (H4D), Lean Startup/I-Corps","produces paradigm shifting innovation, produces entrepeneurs","Skunworks - like team in dod","Set of 6 principles adopted by several donors and organizations to incorporate innovations in international development","approaches of using innovative contracting and multisector partnership","approaches, programs, methodologies, source innovators, change the way we do business","innovation design team with global development lab","programs and approaches","US Global Development Lab innovation lab within USAID","Venture capital, grant program ","We onboard experts onto our team that can help quantify the impact of the innovative work people are doing across government.

Although there is significant academic CM&S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product.","Most undergraduate engineering programs have some type of senior design program or senior capstone project which is a part of an engineering design course. Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students\u2019 creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program.","The FDA's Modeling and Simulation Working Group (ModSim WG) started as a grassroots movement to coordinate modeling expertise at FDA. There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature.","Leads lean efforts ","Helping HHS  to engage their users in content development","knowledgeable abour PRA (Paper Reduction Act) and how to do UX (user experience)","NaN","Work on innovation projects of CMS","https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/04/making-a-difference-innovation-pathway-and-entrepreneurs-in-residence/","NaN","Conducted a employee survey ","Developing intel policies and procedures ","Thinking about underseved populations like children","Follows principles 2, 4, 5","cross-agency security group for mobile","Government problems shared with higher education + the Lean Startup method to connect with industry course","Approaches and program","Conduct challenges","NaN","Developing and implementing new methods of internal business processes/process management","New technology for secretary's communciation and sounding board","Innovative ways to bring interns into government (vsfs.state.gov)","Innovation Lab and iLead","programs and approaches","NaN","Secretary of state's team responsible for collaboration between state, public, and private sector and civil society, the home of innovation at state!","developing innovation policy","developing an innovation community within state","YALI program","Top innovation thinker for Army","Principle #1: Anyone can innovate. innovation challenges like Google 20%","Actual specific innovating, approach","Manages large scale culture change","NaN","Provide independent advice and recommendations to DOD on innovative means to address future challenges in terms of integrated change to organizational structure and processes, business and functional concepts, and technology applications","create and disseminate new ideas, tech, products, processes","Hackathons, Hacking 4 Defense (H4X), (H4D), Lean Startup/I-Corps","produces paradigm shifting innovation, produces entrepeneurs","Skunworks - like team in dod","Set of 6 principles adopted by several donors and organizations to incorporate innovations in international development","approaches of using innovative contracting and multisector partnership","approaches, programs, methodologies, source innovators, change the way we do business","innovation design team with global development lab","programs and approaches","US Global Development Lab innovation lab within USAID","Venture capital, grant program ","We onboard experts onto our team that can help quantify the impact of the innovative work people are doing across government.

Although there is significant academic CM&S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product.","Most undergraduate engineering programs have some type of senior design program or senior capstone project which is a part of an engineering design course. Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students\u2019 creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program.","The FDA's Modeling and Simulation Working Group (ModSim WG) started as a grassroots movement to coordinate modeling expertise at FDA. There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature.","Leads lean efforts ","Helping HHS  to engage their users in content development","knowledgeable abour PRA (Paper Reduction Act) and how to do UX (user experience)","NaN","Work on innovation projects of CMS","https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/04/making-a-difference-innovation-pathway-and-entrepreneurs-in-residence/","NaN","Conducted a employee survey ","Developing intel policies and procedures ","Thinking about underseved populations like children","Follows principles 2, 4, 5","cross-agency security group for mobile","Government problems shared with higher education + the Lean Startup method to connect with industry course","Approaches and program","Conduct challenges","NaN","Developing and implementing new methods of internal business processes/process management","New technology for secretary's communciation and sounding board","Innovative ways to bring interns into government (vsfs.state.gov)","Innovation Lab and iLead","programs and approaches","NaN","Secretary of state's team responsible for collaboration between state, public, and private sector and civil society, the home of innovation at state!","developing innovation policy","developing an innovation community within state","YALI program","Top innovation thinker for Army","Principle #1: Anyone can innovate. innovation challenges like Google 20%","Actual specific innovating, approach","Manages large scale culture change","NaN","Provide independent advice and recommendations to DOD on innovative means to address future challenges in terms of integrated change to organizational structure and processes, business and functional concepts, and technology applications","create and disseminate new ideas, tech, products, processes","Hackathons, Hacking 4 Defense (H4X), (H4D), Lean Startup/I-Corps","produces paradigm shifting innovation, produces entrepeneurs","Skunworks - like team in dod","Set of 6 principles adopted by several donors and organizations to incorporate innovations in international development","approaches of using innovative contracting and multisector partnership","approaches, programs, methodologies, source innovators, change the way we do business","innovation design team with global development lab","programs and approaches","US Global Development Lab innovation lab within USAID","Venture capital, grant program ","We onboard experts onto our team that can help quantify the impact of the innovative work people are doing across government.

Although there is significant academic CM&S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product.","Most undergraduate engineering programs have some type of senior design program or senior capstone project which is a part of an engineering design course. Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students\u2019 creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program.","The FDA's Modeling and Simulation Working Group (ModSim WG) started as a grassroots movement to coordinate modeling expertise at FDA. There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature.","Leads lean efforts ","Helping HHS  to engage their users in content development","knowledgeable abour PRA (Paper Reduction Act) and how to do UX (user experience)","NaN","Work on innovation projects of CMS","https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/04/making-a-difference-innovation-pathway-and-entrepreneurs-in-residence/","NaN","Conducted a employee survey ","Developing intel policies and procedures ","Thinking about underseved populations like children","Follows principles 2, 4, 5","cross-agency security group for mobile","Government problems shared with higher education + the Lean Startup method to connect with industry course","Approaches and program","Conduct challenges","NaN","Developing and implementing new methods of internal business processes/process management","New technology for secretary's communciation and sounding board","Innovative ways to bring interns into government (vsfs.state.gov)","Innovation Lab and iLead","programs and approaches","NaN","Secretary of state's team responsible for collaboration between state, public, and private sector and civil society, the home of innovation at state!","developing innovation policy","developing an innovation community within state","YALI program","Top innovation thinker for Army","Principle #1: Anyone can innovate. innovation challenges like Google 20%","Actual specific innovating, approach","Manages large scale culture change","NaN","Provide independent advice and recommendations to DOD on innovative means to address future challenges in terms of integrated change to organizational structure and processes, business and functional concepts, and technology applications","create and disseminate new ideas, tech, products, processes","Hackathons, Hacking 4 Defense (H4X), (H4D), Lean Startup/I-Corps","produces paradigm shifting innovation, produces entrepeneurs","Skunworks - like team in dod","Set of 6 principles adopted by several donors and organizations to incorporate innovations in international development","approaches of using innovative contracting and multisector partnership","approaches, programs, methodologies, source innovators, change the way we do business","innovation design team with global development lab","programs and approaches","US Global Development Lab innovation lab within USAID","Venture capital, grant program ","We onboard experts onto our team that can help quantify the impact of the innovative work people are doing across government.

Although there is significant academic CM&S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product.","Most undergraduate engineering programs have some type of senior design program or senior capstone project which is a part of an engineering design course. Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students\u2019 creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program.","The FDA's Modeling and Simulation Working Group (ModSim WG) started as a grassroots movement to coordinate modeling expertise at FDA. There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature.","Leads lean efforts ","Helping HHS  to engage their users in content development","knowledgeable abour PRA (Paper Reduction Act) and how to do UX (user experience)","NaN","Work on innovation projects of CMS","https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/04/making-a-difference-innovation-pathway-and-entrepreneurs-in-residence/","NaN","Conducted a employee survey ","Developing intel policies and procedures ","Thinking about underseved populations like children","Follows principles 2, 4, 5","cross-agency security group for mobile","Government problems shared with higher education + the Lean Startup method to connect with industry course","Approaches and program","Conduct challenges","NaN","Developing and implementing new methods of internal business processes/process management","New technology for secretary's communciation and sounding board","Innovative ways to bring interns into government (vsfs.state.gov)","Innovation Lab and iLead","programs and approaches","NaN","Secretary of state's team responsible for collaboration between state, public, and private sector and civil society, the home of innovation at state!","developing innovation policy","developing an innovation community within state","YALI program","Top innovation thinker for Army","Principle #1: Anyone can innovate. innovation challenges like Google 20%","Actual specific innovating, approach","Manages large scale culture change","NaN","Provide independent advice and recommendations to DOD on innovative means to address future challenges in terms of integrated change to organizational structure and processes, business and functional concepts, and technology applications","create and disseminate new ideas, tech, products, processes","Hackathons, Hacking 4 Defense (H4X), (H4D), Lean Startup/I-Corps","produces paradigm shifting innovation, produces entrepeneurs","Skunworks - like team in dod","Set of 6 principles adopted by several donors and organizations to incorporate innovations in international development","approaches of using innovative contracting and multisector partnership","approaches, programs, methodologies, source innovators, change the way we do business","innovation design team with global development lab","programs and approaches","US Global Development Lab innovation lab within USAID","Venture capital, grant program ","We onboard experts onto our team that can help quantify the impact of the innovative work people are doing across government.

Although there is significant academic CM&S used to develop biologic medical products, there is little regulatory experience with CM&S for this application. I worked with modelers across the agency and biologic product experts at the Center for Biologic Evaluation and Research to develop methods for reviewing CM&S for biologic products that combines practices from multiple groups. This effort resulted in a guided regulatory review tool and training materials to help regulators with little to no CM&S expertise to assess the credibility and regulatory utility of CM&S submitted as part of an application to test or market a biologic product.","Most undergraduate engineering programs have some type of senior design program or senior capstone project which is a part of an engineering design course. Sponsoring a senior design project can be a useful mechanism to amplify a researcher's scientific/engineering effort directed at a specific challenge and can leverage the students\u2019 creativity and motivation if implemented effectively. This novel program created partnerships with student groups to work on regulatory science projects for their senior design. This interaction advances regulatory science and serves to educate the students in medical product regulation. A document detailing suggestions for best practices was developed to facilitate the sustainability of this program.","The FDA's Modeling and Simulation Working Group (ModSim WG) started as a grassroots movement to coordinate modeling expertise at FDA. There was a strong desire among modelers at the FDA to learn about one another and to collaborate outside of their immediate Offices and Divisions. Similarly, there was a need to develop a harmonized FDA voice supporting modeling research and establishing review methods for assessing modeling included in regulatory submissions. The ModSim WG was charted in 2016 and has an organizational structure that is unique among FDA working groups: the ModSim WG facilitates the creation of \"Implementation Teams\" that form around a key cross-cutting issue or deliverable and exist until the goal of the team is met. These teams are formed from the group's general membership, as needed, and are interdisciplinary in nature.","Leads lean efforts ","Helping HHS  to engage their users in content development","knowledgeable abour PRA (Paper Reduction Act) and how to do UX (user experience)","NaN","Work on innovation projects of CMS","https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2012/04/making-a-difference-innovation-pathway-and-entrepreneurs-in-residence/","NaN","Conducted a employee survey ","Developing intel policies and procedures ","Thinking about underseved populations like children","Follows principles 2, 4, 5","cross-agency security group for mobile","Government problems shared with higher education + the Lean Startup method to connect with industry course","Approaches and program","Conduct challenges","NaN","Developing and implementing new methods of internal business processes/process management","New technology for secretary's communciation and sounding board","Innovative ways to bring interns into government (vsfs.state.gov)","Innovation Lab and iLead","programs and approaches","NaN","Secretary of state's team responsible for collaboration between state, public, and private sector and civil society, the home of innovation at state!","developing innovation policy","developing an innovation community within state","YALI program","Top innovation thinker for Army","Principle #1: Anyone can innovate. innovation challenges like Google 20%","Actual specific innovating, approach","Manages large scale culture change","NaN","Provide independent advice and recommendations to DOD on innovative means to address future challenges in terms of integrated change to organizational structure and processes, business and functional concepts, and technology applications","create and disseminate new ideas, tech, products, processes","Hackathons, Hacking 4 Defense (H4X), (H4D), Lean Startup/I-Corps","produces paradigm shifting innovation, produces entrepeneurs","Skunworks - like team in dod","Set of 6 principles adopted by several donors and organizations to incorporate innovations in international development","approaches of using innovative contracting and multisector partnership","approaches, programs, methodologies, source innovators, change the way we do business","innovation design team with global development lab","programs and approaches","US Global Development Lab innovation lab within USAID","Venture capital, grant program ","We onboard experts onto our team that can help quantify the impact of the innovative work people are doing across government.
